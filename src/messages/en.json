          "q": "Is this better than flashcards?",
          "a": "Flashcards mainly test memory. Shadowing is different: you listen to native audio with adjustable playback speed and configurable pauses for speaking. It's immersive listening and speaking practice. You're training your ears and mouth to work at conversation speed, not just testing if you remember a translation. It's the difference between knowing a word and being able to use it when someone's actually talking to you. (We also have a quiz mode if you want traditional memory testing.)"
